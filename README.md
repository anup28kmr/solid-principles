# SOLID-Principles in JAVA

## S - Single Responsibility
A class should have one, and only one responsibility and reason to change.

## O - Open-Closed
A class should be open for extension but closed for modification

## L - Liskov Substitution
Subtypes(derived classes) should be replaceable by their base(parent class) types

## I - Interface Segregation
Many specific interfaces are better than a general interface

## D - Dependency Inversion
We must depend on abstractions and not concrete classes
